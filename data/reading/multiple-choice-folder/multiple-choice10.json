You could never get a table to yourself there, and whoever sat with you always wanted to complain about the shop, the customers, the management or the canteen food. Everyone at Harrison's seemed to have a complaint of some kind, although it was one of the best Sydney stores to work for, and many of the staff had been there for years – some of them were long past retiring age. This was because the management let them stay on when they were really past it, like poor old Thomas, who was always trying to sell people designs that would look old for them.",

She was said to be Mr Davies's right-hand person – and heaven knows she liked him, though she was sometimes asked into his office to meet a favoured publisher's representative. The book department, partly due to Mr Davies's weak administration, but partly because it was thought to be sophisticated, was the only department in Harrison's where you did not have to wear black. This led to some confusion as to who was an assistant, not atypical of bookshops, and accounted for the distressed look of people who picked up a book they wanted but were afraid that someone would grab it for the store detective before they could find someone to take their money.",
