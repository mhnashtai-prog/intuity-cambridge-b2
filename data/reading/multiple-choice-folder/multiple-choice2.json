With the arrival of autumn and winter, the appeal of Iceland's cities and villages intensifies. I'm a keen admirer of historical characters; with historical tales, my fascination with Iceland began in my late teens. Set in 1918, in a remote town of Reykjavik, it tells the story of a young boy whose parents have passed away. He is sent to live in the breathtaking landscape of Akureyri with his uncle and cousins. They live in a series of small cottages scattered across the countryside.",
