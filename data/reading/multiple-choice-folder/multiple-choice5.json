There was already a crowd of a quarter past. Now, after twenty seven mystery novels, Helena Morrison was a success! Her Detective Inspector Rivers series had made it to the small screen; the first three episodes had been shown, to great critical acclaim, and Helena had become about as familiar a face to the public as they got. She'd been interviewed on television and had featured prominently in magazines. After all, becoming an 'overnight success' at one's seventies was quite newsworthy.",

About five minutes later, though, she stopped. Anything less made her feel that if she couldn't wait to get away; anything more risked losing the audience's attention.",

      "text": "After the reading, people formed an orderly queue, and Helena signed their books, pausing to chat briefly with everyone, asking if they wanted any specific sort of dedication and making sure the spelling of their names was right. Helena looked down at her wrinkled hand as she signed. Hands were the first to go, she thought. The rest of her was remarkably well preserved. She had regained tall and lean. She hadn't shrunk or got fat like so many elderly women. Steel-grey hair, pulled back tightly and fastened at the back, framed the deep blue eyes in her strong thin face; her nose was slightly hooked and her lips thin. Not a face that smiled often, people thought. And they were right, even though it had not always been so.",

'What was the name of the place where you lived?' 'It was a long time ago.' 'Did you go by the same name then?' 'Look, I...' 'Excuse me, sir.' It was Adrian, politely asking the man to move along. He did as he was asked, and left. Adrian brought Helena a glass of wine and she carried on signing. When it was all over, Adrian and the staff drove her home to a long hot bath.",
