There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to previous owners, who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Julia. She also inherited the gardener, Marcus. In fact, it was really Marcus who convinced her to buy the cottage, she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, \"Oh, it's one of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted a bird bath, he recognised what I had in mind.\"",

      "text": "Julia prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'",

      "text": "Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. They all come out together, and you're so busy, she cuts them and photographs them to work from later. Julia has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't particularly interested in gardening then. In fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they were artificial – to me, the only real ones were wild.' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.",
