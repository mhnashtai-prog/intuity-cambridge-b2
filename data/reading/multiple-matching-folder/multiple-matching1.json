  "subtitle": "An architect describes his career and experiences in different firms and managing his own company.",
  "sections": {
    "A": "After I graduated, I took the first job I was offered... Almost from day one, I was left on my own for several days a week... I got to do it all. When I left the job, I remember going into an interview with a larger firm and telling them that I had all this experience. The person interviewing me chuckled and said, 'You won't be doing that here straightaway — that's what the senior employees do.'",
    "B": "I now run my own small company. We really need everyone in the office to be superstars. We expect initiative, and employees must use resources, ask questions, learn from past projects. They have space to work independently. Any issues with behaviour get sorted out directly. Employees are the company’s greatest asset.",
    "C": "I often get asked if architecture is a field for everyone. What I look for in potential employees is their ability to speak articulately. This is essential, since all employees must meet with clients and present. I also believe it takes a certain kind of brain to practise architecture.",
    "D": "Many architectural projects require large teams. While most students dream of being the 'next great designer,' the reality is that buildings demand a small army of people from many different backgrounds to complete."
