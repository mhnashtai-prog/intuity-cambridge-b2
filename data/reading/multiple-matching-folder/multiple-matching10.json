    "A": "The art of Ebru can produce stunning results. It involves painting on the surface of water, then transferring the moving image to paper or fabric. The results are spectacularâ€”strikingly contemporary, yet rooted in the tradition of a centuries-old art form. There are two key ingredients: tragacanth, a soft gum which makes the water more dense, and ox gall. The ox gall has two essential properties: first, it allows colours to float and spread on the surface of the water, second, it prevents the colour from merging or simply dissolving.",
    "B": "An Ebru artist, Hayrettin Kozanoglu, demonstrates by dipping a brush into pots of vivid colours arranged around a shallow tray of water, then sprinkling paint onto the surface. 'I can drop on green, then blue on top, then add yellow, and the colours stay completely separate,' he says. He takes a small comb and swirls it across the surface. Instead of the colours merging into a muddy mess, the tray fills with swirling designs of the kind seen inside the covers of old hardback books. Finally, Kozanoglu places a piece of paper onto the tray and slides it out. The pattern he created in the tray has been transferred to the sheet with absolute precision.",
    "C": "Prior to arriving in Europe in the 17th century, a similar art form to Ebru had developed across Asia. A 10th-century Chinese book mentions 'drifting sand notepaper' made by dragging paper through a fermented flour paste mixed with colours. In 12th century Japan, 'suminagashi' or 'floating ink' was known. By the 15th century, India and central Asia had their own versions. The Turkish tradition of Ebru dates to the 19th century and the work of several masters, who passed on their skills to apprentices.",
    "D": "Ebru artists are renowned for intricate depictions of flowers, as well as abstract patterns. Kozanoglu explains that the technique is evolving: 'Before the 20th century, it was only about flowers. As more people are learning about Ebru, interesting experiments are happening. Artists are creating landscapes and even portraits, although it takes years of practice to reach that level. The beauty of Ebru is that you can create attractive and complex works of art quickly and easily. Ebru has the potential to surprise us because the water and paint permit new things to happen.'",
    "E": "Kozanoglu recognises the therapeutic value of Ebru in helping people with emotional problems: 'To make Ebru art, you need to concentrate, to be calm and patient. Also, the colours you choose can reflect your personality, your mood and your circumstances. Water is the source of life and I believe it holds memories. That's why the connection between water and paint is important. Ebru gives pleasure to those who practise it and shows the power of water in creating a more colourful world.'"
