  "sections": {
    "A": "Katie on the Harry Potter books: At age 11, her younger sister forced her to read the first book. She loved it, finished all of them, and identified with Hermione as a role model. It encouraged her to work hard at school and even helped her and her sister stop fighting, giving them a bond. Later they visited Harry Potter film locations in the UK.",
    "B": "Sally on the musical Les Misérables: Initially thought it didn’t sound special. When she finally watched it, she was amazed and has now seen it over 1,000 times, spending large sums. She prefers it over other musicals because it is always entertaining. She accepts people might think her obsession strange, but she compares it with harmless hobbies like fishing.",
    "C": "Cami on the opera star Andrea Bocelli: First saw him by accident on TV while expecting a travel program. His voice touched her deeply. She and her husband began attending his concerts worldwide. While initially worried about being judged, they found a community of fans and made friends internationally. Supporting his tours is expensive but their only indulgence.",
    "D": "Jane on the pop singer Madonna: First saw her on TV by chance when bored, was instantly captivated by her energy. This led to posters, concerts all around the world, and a deep personal identity as a Madonna fan. She doesn’t care about Madonna’s popularity and considers her fandom part of who she is. She has been to over 90 concerts and loves the circus-like shows."
