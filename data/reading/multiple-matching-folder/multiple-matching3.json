  "sections": {
    "A": "I set up my company Sporting Edge a decade ago to share practical tools promoting success in sport. I specialise in the mental side of high performance. The role is more widely accepted now. Top athletes openly credit their mental training, driving others to do the same. Earlier, mistrust came from the perception that successful people should appear 'perfect' and without doubts. Now it's seen as positive to address imperfections in the mental game, just like in the physical one.",
    "B": "Part of my role is working with players and coaches to focus on conditions for success. I teach them not to let emotions affect performance negatively. Once they manage feelings better, they can make clearer, more logical plans. Everyone wants instant results, but patience and long-term planning are vital. As a former international sportsman, I know this first-hand.",
    "C": "Recent science shows how mental habits shape performance. Brain scans confirm that self-talk establishes new neural structures, so repeated patterns influence action. We must keep thinking habits healthy. Training concentration routines is crucial—athletes must block distractions and stay focused. Mental strength, like physical, can be developed deliberately.",
    "D": "While training sessions are mainly physical, mental skills underpin every aspect: decision-making, confidence, teamwork, and focus. Coaches often find these harder to teach. This is where sports psychologists help, by guiding coaches to reinforce mental abilities during practice, adjust instruction methods, and facilitate communication in teams.",
    "E": "Elite performers often feel relief rather than joy at success, driven by fear of failure. Society ties identity to professional achievement, making athletes desperate never to disappoint. We would benefit from enjoying the process of competition, not just its results. Yet sport is judged on winning moments, and athletes’ careers are remembered by them."
