  "subtitle": "Four graduates talk about their experiences.",
  "sections": {
    "A": "Sonia: While I was doing my physics degree people often said I was developing skills useful beyond physics. I doubted this, as knowing atomic structure or lasers didn’t seem relevant. Later I realised they meant transferable skills such as communication and problem-solving. University demands independent thought and innovation. It also brought me lifelong friends and work contacts.",
    "B": "Jane: I went to university as it was the expected path at school, at home, and among classmates. I was unaware of other solid alternatives. My job requires a degree, although other ways of gaining skills must exist. A degree remains a screening tool for employers. For many, the actual subject studied is barely relevant to later jobs. It opens career doors even though its practical value varies.",
    "C": "Lydia: Teenagers are under pressure to choose their future early. As a high achiever, non-university paths didn’t appeal, so I took a place at a good university but studied something I wasn’t sure I wanted. Some know their aims early and succeed, but most at 18 lack clarity. More choices should be offered rather than pushing everyone onto degree courses.",
    "D": "Bethany: I don’t recall choosing to go; it was assumed I would, though I wasn’t academically gifted. In my second year I questioned why I had gone and couldn’t answer. Perhaps upbringing or school expectations? Regardless, I enjoyed it and learned valuable life skills. Since graduation, I’ve had many jobs. University is great for some careers, but working straight away is equally valid for others."
