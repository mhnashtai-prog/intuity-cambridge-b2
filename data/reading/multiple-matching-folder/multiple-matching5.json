  "sections": {
    "A": "Mark: As a cyclist, I carry bananas and protein bars during rides, eating regularly. On intensive days, food alone doesn’t meet energy needs, so I use energy drinks. Sports nutrition now focuses more on protein compared to when I swam. Cycling requires eating differently, keeping muscles lean and strong. I usually eat healthily, but allow myself the occasional takeaway, selecting meals carefully.",
    "B": "Stefan: People assume I’m on a restrictive diet, but I eat sensibly with both vegetables and chocolate. I do most of the cooking at home. On competition mornings I’m too nervous to eat but must force myself. Occasionally I relax my diet: after hard training, I allow myself pizza. Treats aren’t daily, or I’d gain weight. I need discipline but also some flexibility.",
    "C": "Guy: As a gymnast, even a kilo matters. I must eat the right amount, at the right time—usually two hours before training. My diet includes fruit, toast, and balanced meals. For dinner I avoid mixing carbs and meat late at night. I enjoy cooking but struggle with planning and timing. I learned cooking from my mum but it takes me longer to get organised.",
    "D": "Tomas: As a swimmer, I balance healthy eating with indulgence. I dislike relying on endless protein shakes. A banana before training is better. At the world championships, I got my food strategy wrong—failing to carb load—and my performance collapsed. Carb loading two days prior is key. I love baking pastries, which relaxes me. Cooking is the perfect counterbalance to heavy training."
