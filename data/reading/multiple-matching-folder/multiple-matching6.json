  "sections": {
    "A": "Science for All: The programme explains mysteries of nature in an entertaining and clear way, like a patient parent answering children’s questions. It has kept quality high across series. Topics such as life on other planets and human memory are well chosen. While factual programmes are becoming rare, this one shows no decline.",
    "B": "Out in Space: Covering hurricanes, deserts, and the Moon’s creation, all linked to space phenomena. The approach is broad but lacks detail, often jumping quickly between topics. The presenters try to tie ideas together through activities, but not always successfully. Initially unpromising, the series turned out worthwhile.",
    "C": "Stars and Planets: Built on the success of the first series, with wide-ranging ideas about time and space. It uses amazing visuals but succeeds most when the presenter explains directly in simple terms. The aim is not deep understanding but inspiring awe and thought. It carefully balances breadth with accessibility.",
    "D": "Robot Technology: Following scientists attempting to build a human from robotic parts, using bionic limbs, artificial organs, and chips. Long a dream, the project shows how far technology can replace or even improve body functions. The presenter, who has an artificial hand, guides the audience. Exciting but sometimes disturbing, it highlights a medical revolution."
