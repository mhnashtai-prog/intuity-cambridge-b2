In fact, he's lucky to be alive; a 'great white' once {{18}} to bite him in half.\n\nThree decades {{19}} this near-fatal attack, Fox still carries the physical scars, but feels {{20}} hate for his attacker. Instead he organises three or four trips {{21}} year to bring scientists and photographers to the kingdom of the great white shark. {{22}} main aim of these trips is to improve people's understanding of an animal {{23}} evil reputation has become an excuse for killing it.\n\nGreat white sharks are not as amusing as dolphins and seals, {{24}} their role in the ocean is critical. They kill off sick animals, helping to prevent the spread {{25}} disease and to maintain the balance in the ocean's food chains. Fox feels a responsibility to act {{26}} a guardian of great white sharks. {{27}} the scientists, film makers and photographers can communicate their sense of wonder {{28}} other people, he is confident that understanding {{29}} replace hatred.",
