Instead he organises three or four trips {{6}} year to bring scientists and photographers to the kingdom of the great white shark. {{7}} main aim of these trips is to improve people's understanding of an animal {{8}} evil reputation has become an excuse for killing it.\n\nGreat white sharks are not as amusing as dolphins and seals, {{9}} their role in the ocean is critical. They kill off sick animals, helping to prevent the spread {{10}} disease and to maintain the balance in the ocean's food chains. Fox feels a responsibility to act {{11}} a guardian of great white sharks. {{12}} the scientists, film makers and photographers can communicate their sense of wonder {{13}} other people, he is confident that understanding {{14}} replace hatred {{15}} time.",
