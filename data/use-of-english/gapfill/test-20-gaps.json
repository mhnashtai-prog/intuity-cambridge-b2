I first became interested {{4}} my own family history four or five years {{5}} when my mother showed me some photographs which I {{6}} never seen before - faded photos of uncles and aunts, great-uncles and great-aunts and grandparents, all taken {{7}} they were young. I immediately wanted to try to trace my family tree back as far {{8}} I could, and decided {{9}} start with the photos. First {{10}} all I had to rely completely {{11}} my mother's memory for names (first names and family names), the ages of people in the photos, the year the photos might {{12}} been taken, and so on. Then after {{13}}, I wanted her to fill in for me details of {{14}} members of the family who weren't in the photos. Again, she was able to recall {{15}} a lot of information - but not enough, I'm afraid. So the next step was to go and consult public records of births, marriages and deaths. Normally, I would {{16}}, reading such information in old record books might be pretty boring {{17}} you're a historian, that is: but it's a very different matter when you're looking for {{18}} about your own ancestors. It's fascinating to discover, as I did, for example, that one of your grandfathers - the one that you thought {{19}} spent his whole life on a farm in the south of England - had actually gone and lived in the USA for some five years when he was a young {{20}} back in the 1890s!",

Or can you think {{2}} some other form of transport which really attracts you?\n\nIn the end, it's all academic really, isn't it, {{3}} the majority of us are forced to use one particular mode of transport. The fact {{4}} many of us live anything up to 100 miles or more from the place we work {{5}}, for example, immediately cuts out any idea of walking every day! But while {{6}} applies to some, others are forced to use public transport (the bus, for example), because {{7}} daily objective (school, college or workplace) is situated in the centre of a traffic-free zone in the city - 'traffic-free', {{8}} is, apart from public transport. Much as such people might like to drive right from their {{9}} front door direct to their office or shop or factory (or at least to a car park nearby), they have {{10}} choice in the matter: they can drive so far - and no {{11}}! Then if there is some form of public transport on offer - bus, tram or underground - they take it: {{12}} they walk. It has {{13}} suggested, perhaps not surprisingly, that commuting (that is, travelling long distances to and {{14}} work every day) reduces productivity, and I'm sure that must be true to some {{15}}. At {{16}} it might account for the fact that some companies are now trying to recruit more employees {{17}} live near the factory or offices.
