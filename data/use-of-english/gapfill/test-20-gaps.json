A cyclist shouted to him as he passed, \"Watch out! There's a herd of cows blocking the way just {{7}} the next corner.\" Edward was afraid {{8}} cows, and decided to turn back and wait. He stopped in the middle of the road, but he didn't notice a car racing {{9}} him. The car knocked him {{10}} and he {{11}} unconscious to the ground. The driver was most upset and said to himself crossly, \"If {{12}} he had been looking where he was going!\" He ran to a telephone box, which luckily was just {{13}}, to call an ambulance. Edward had cut {{14}} head but {{15}} seemed unharmed. Thinking about it {{16}} as he lay recovering in hospital, he told {{17}} he wouldn't ever be so careless {{18}}. He would stay alert however much in love and not go about {{19}} his head in the {{20}}.",

I immediately wanted to try to trace my family tree back as far {{8}} I could, and decided {{9}} start with the photos. First {{10}} all I had to rely completely {{11}} my mother's memory for names (first names and family names), the ages of people in the photos, the year the photos might {{12}} been taken, and so on. Then after {{13}}, I wanted her to fill in for me details of {{14}} members of the family who weren't in the photos. Again, she was able to recall {{15}} a lot of information - but not enough, I'm afraid. So the next step was to go and consult public records of births, marriages and deaths. Normally, I would {{16}}, reading such information in old record books might be pretty boring {{17}} you're a historian, that is: but it's a very different matter when you're looking for {{18}} about your own ancestors. It's fascinating to discover, as I did, for example, that one of your grandfathers - the one that you thought {{19}} spent his whole life on a farm in the south of England - had actually gone and lived in the USA for some five years when he was a young man back in the 1890s {{20}} returning!",

Or can you think {{2}} some other form of transport which really attracts you?\n\nIn the end, it's all academic really, isn't it, {{3}} the majority of us are forced to use one particular mode of transport.

Much as such people might like to drive right from their {{9}} front door direct to their office or shop or factory (or at least to a car park nearby), they have {{10}} choice in the matter: they can drive so far - and no {{11}}!
