A year later the cat turned up at its old home even {{2}} this was 1,360 kilometres away from where its owners were now living.\n\nOther cats may not travel so far but many keep {{3}} going back to their old home. Pilsbury, an English cat, made a 13-kilometre journey back to its former home 40 times in spite {{4}} having to cross several busy roads to do so.\n\nPigeons also have the homing instinct and, over {{5}} centuries, human beings have used them to carry messages back home. However, cat owners, {{6}} have to keep returning to their old address in order to bring their cat home, tend {{7}} find the homing instinct simply irritating.",
