        "content": "Artist Carmen Rodriguez, sixty-five, says the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, <span class=\"evidence-text\" data-questions=\"12\">you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.</span><br><br>Carmen has always been interested in plants. 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside.' In the garden, she wasn't much interested in gardening then; 'I thought they were artificial looking. I only really liked ones that were wild.' Nowadays, <span class=\"evidence-text\" data-questions=\"13\">the garden owes its beauty to imported plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to play about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.</span><br><br>With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to paint is never a problem for Carmen recently. She now employs an extra gardener, but admits she needs to paint, she knows that, <span class=\"evidence-text\" data-questions=\"10\">to maintain her connection with her subject matter, you have to get your hands dirty.</span><br><br>Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy' she says. <span class=\"evidence-text\" data-questions=\"11\">'I take one flower out and paint it which is how I like to work, and then bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'</span><br><br>Carmen prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants when positioned so as to provide the best viewing angle for the artist. <span class=\"evidence-text\" data-questions=\"10\">She also inherited the gardener, Diego. 'In fact, I was really not interested in gardening.' We got on very well at first but he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to plant them, he recognized what I had in mind.</span>"

Our travel correspondent reports.<br><br>'You must remember that these dolphins are wild. They are not fed or caged in any way. These encounters are purely on the dolphins' terms.' So said one of our guides, as we boarded the boat before we set out for our rendezvous.<br><br>[15]<br><br>No skill is required to swim with dolphins, just enthusiasm. But we are warned that due to sea conditions, not all trips result in close encounters with the animals. Once on board the boat we sailed for about forty-five minutes, unsure of what we could expect from our trip.<br><br>[16]<br><br>About half an hour later we had our first sighting: a grey fin breaking the surface, followed by the distinctive arched back and long pointed nose, as we circled the area of sea where they were playing. In a few minutes we could see a dozen or more dolphins, and we prepared for our first encounter with several of them, though only the best swimmers among us could hope to get a close experience.<br><br>[17]<br><br>Soon we were in the middle of a much larger pod, with dolphins all around us. The first group of six or seven dolphins had drawn us in close, then more swam alongside the boat, racing and overtaking us until they could surf on the boat's bow wave.<br><br>[18]<br><br>Actually visibility was not at its best, but we had the extraordinary experience of hearing the dolphins' clicking sounds and high-pitched squeaks. The dolphins did not really seem to tire of our presence in the water; they seemed to be genuinely socializing with us rather than just investigating something unusual.<br><br>[19]<br><br>They had finally finished feeding and were content to play alongside the boat as we made our way slowly back toward shore. Soon most of us had spent at least a few magical seconds in the sea with them. We watched as hundreds of seabirds wheeled through the distance.<br><br>[20]<br><br>The guides are beginning to recognize some of the local dolphins by the markings on their backs, and some individuals appear time after time. These encounters help scientists better understand dolphin behavior and migration patterns.<br><br>[21]<br><br>For most people, though, the experience is simply a fun day out that can lead to a deeper appreciation for marine life and ocean conservation."
