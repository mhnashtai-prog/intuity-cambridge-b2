        "title": "Elena's Success",
        "content": "The book signing at the department store started at half past six, but Elena Rodriguez had told her publicist, Sofia, that she liked to arrive early, get familiar with the place and have a chat with the staff. There was already a crowd at a quarter past. Now, after twenty novels in as many years, Elena Rodriguez was a household name. Detective Amanda Santos made it to the bestseller screen; the first three episodes had been shown to great critical acclaim, and Elena had become about as familiar a face to the general public as a writer ever is. She had been interviewed on television and had featured prominently in magazines. After all, becoming successful at seventy was quite noteworthy.<br><br>At 6.30 on the dot, Elena picked up her copy of the book, organized herself on her chair, and began to read. About five minutes was enough, she reckoned. Anything less made her feel as if she couldn't wait to get away; anything more risked losing the audience's attention.<br><br>After the reading, people formed an orderly queue, and Elena signed their books, pausing to chat briefly with everyone, asking if they seemed good specific sort of dedication and enjoying some of the spell that befell them all right.<br><br>Elena looked up, startled by his voice. The man appeared to be about sixty, painfully thin, with a long, lined face. He was tall, with long, deep-sunk legs, and he held the book out for her to sign.<br><br>'What was the name of the place where you lived?' he asked.<br><br>Elena nodded. 'A long time ago.' Then she looked at the book. 'What would you like me to sign this to?'<br><br>'It was a long time ago.'<br><br>'Did you go by the same name then?'<br><br>'Look, I...'<br><br>'Excuse me, sir.' It was Sofia, politely asking the man to move along. He did as he was asked, and left Sofia lingered. Elena a glass of wine and she carried on signing. When it was all over, Sofia and the staff suggested dinner, but Elena was tired. All she wanted to do was go home by a long hot bath.<br><br>Elena had a hand on Sofia's forearm. 'No, my dear,' she said. 'I'll be perfectly all right now I'm at over the hill yet.'<br><br>Sofia blanched. She had probably been told that Elena was prickly. Someone always warned the publicist.<br><br>'I'm sorry, I didn't mean to suggest anything like that. It's my job.'<br><br>Sofia smiled and looked at her watch. 'Well, perhaps if I phone my boyfriend we could get some last-minute theatre tickets. But only if you're sure.'<br><br>'Quite sure, my dear. Good night.'<br><br>As she walked to the underground, Elena thought again about the strange man in the bookshop. She didn't like to dwell on the past but he had pushed her into a reminiscent mood, so had the recent newspaper photograph of the latest and over the last year. The first time the newspaper photographer came crawling back, Elena shouldered at she walked down the steps to the underground."
