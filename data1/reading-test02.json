        "content": "Artist Carmen Rodriguez, sixty-five, says: But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'<br><br>Carmen has always been interested in plants. 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside.' In the garden, she wasn't much interested in gardening then; 'I thought they were artificial looking. I only really liked ones were wild.' Nowadays, the garden owes its beauty to imported plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to play about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.<br><br>With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to paint is never a problem for Carmen recently. She now employs an extra gardener, but admits she need to paint, she knows that, to maintain her connection with her subject matter, you have to get your hands dirty.<br><br>Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it which is how I like to work, and then bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'<br><br>Carmen prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants when positioned so as to provide the best viewing angle for the artist. She also inherited the gardener, Diego. 'In fact, I was really not interested in gardening.' We got on very well at first but would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to plant them, he recognized what I had in mind."

Once on board the boat we sailed for about forty-five minutes, and we could expect from our trip.<br><br>[16]<br><br>About half an hour later we had our first sighting: a grey lower body, and a long pointed nose, as we circled the area of sea where they were.

I made a film which featured a railway as the storyline. Most of the filming took place on an old, disused stretch of the line which had been lovingly maintained by volunteers.
