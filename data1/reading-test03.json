You could never get a table to yourself there, and whenever she sat with you always wanted to complain about the shop, the customers, the management or the canteen food. Everyone at Goldwyn's seemed to have a complaint of some kind.<br><br>[7]<br><br>Christina herself had been in the book department for more than four years. She had started as a junior, teaching everyone prices and breaking the till once a week in her efforts to serve customers quickly. Now she was Head Salesperson and moved calmly around the department between the bright new paperbacks, knowing that book customers liked to take their time, unlike the people who shopped through other parts of the shop with never an increase to spare.<br><br>[8]<br><br>She was told this was Mr Parker's right-hand person – and heaven knows he needed one – and was sometimes asked into his office to meet a favoured publisher's representative.<br><br>[9]<br><br>The book department, partly due to Mr Parker's weak administration and partly because it was thought to be sophisticated, was the only department in Goldwyn's where you did not have to wear black. This led to some confusion as to who was an assistant and who was a customer, not everyone was used to uniformed and accounted for the elderly ladies and lack of people who picked up a book they wanted but were afraid of having their elbows grabbed by the same defective before they could find someone to take their money.<br><br>[10]<br><br>Christina was wearing her grey suit today. She liked the grey suit. She had liked it for a very long time and said of a woman's advice that it was better to buy an expensive suit that would last than to keep buying cheap suits that looked very smart but thin based in the street to look at it, but it would stand having its skirt taken up or let down according to the swings of fashion.<br><br>[11]<br><br>She always had lunch at work, at much or one can't early job that important one, from wine till five-thirty. She liked Goldwyn's, but she was always glad to get away from it at lunchtime, even though it meant queuing for a table in one of the restaurants and tea-shops that fed the local shop-workers. Here people tended to eat with their eyes on the clock, often failing to taste what they ate and thinking only of getting their food down so that they could get back to their jobs on time.<br><br>[12]<br><br>Alice, who was her junior, was always meeting people at lunchtime. Even if it was only a quick coffee in the Goodwill she was always giggling so much that there was nothing so much that life standing up and down with the rest of the world. At Goldwyn's at she was someone."
