        "content": "There was a small breeze when Marina came out for her lunch as she usually did, even when it was raining, instead of going up to the studio canteen. You could never get a table to yourself there, and whenever she sat with you always wanted to complain about the directors, the actors, the management or the canteen food. Everyone at Silver Screen Studios seemed to have a complaint of some kind.<br><br>Marina preferred not to have lunch at work because she wanted to avoid the canteen food. She wasn't particularly interested in the conversations. She found her colleagues were much too old for them. She also inherited the previous assistant's attitude towards the work, and this was because the management, partly due to Mr Rodriguez's weak administration and partly because it was thought to be sophisticated, was the only department in Silver Screen where you did not have to wear the studio uniform. This led to some confusion as to who was an assistant and who was a visitor.<br><br>Marina was wearing her blue suit today. She liked the blue suit. She had liked it for a very long time, she said, of a woman's advice that it was better to buy an expensive suit that would last than to keep buying cheap suits that looked very smart for a short while until they got dirty and lost their shape. The blue suit had been what the shop called a 'classic,' which meant that nobody would ever turn round in the street to look at it, but it would stand having its skirt taken up or let down according to the swings of fashion.<br><br>Marina was wearing her blue suit today. She liked the blue suit. She had worked very hard to earn enough money to afford it. When she first started in the film industry, she worked as an assistant to the food stylist. Her job was to prepare period food for historical dramas. She became fascinated by the research required to make the food look authentic for the time period being filmed.<br><br>'I never really paid much attention to history lessons at school and now this is one of the aspects of the work that I enjoy the most,' she explains. 'The film was set a hundred years ago and my job was to prepare the food for a dinner-party scene.'<br><br>Supermarkets stock most things all year round, but food is not always in the correct form for period dramas. 'Without the use of modern chemicals, vegetables probably looked a bit marked and oddly shaped,' Marina explains. 'And, if it is actually going to be eaten by the actors, hygiene must be considered.'<br><br>Few households of that era would have had an oven, so most meat would have been cooked over a fire. 'The work is obviously good fun, otherwise I wouldn't do it, but it's perhaps not as glamorous as people imagine,' says Marina. 'With a wedding cake or something like that, if it is cut before the director is satisfied with the shot, I have to go and make it look untouched again.'"
