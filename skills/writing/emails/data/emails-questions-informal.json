Then we could spend the morning wandering around the old streets and maybe visit the castle if it's open. We could grab lunch at one of the cafés in the market square and then have a look round the shops in the afternoon before heading back around 5pm. The whole day would probably cost about £30 including travel and food.</p></div></div><div class='email-section'><div class='section-heading'>Action / Request</div><div class='section-content'><p><span class='discourse key-phrase'>Does that sound good to you?</span> If you'd rather do something else we could go to the coast instead or just stay local and visit the museum.

After that we could either have a picnic if the weather's decent or find a pub for lunch. Then maybe stop somewhere for coffee on the way home.
