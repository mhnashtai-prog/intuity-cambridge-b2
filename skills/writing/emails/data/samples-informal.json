I walk past your place every day on my way to uni and I've always thought it looks like a lovely place to work - everyone always seems so friendly.</p><p>I haven't worked as a waitress before, but I'm a fast learner and I'm really keen to give it a go. I did some volunteer work at a community centre last year where I helped out with their lunch service for elderly people, so I've got some experience with serving food and drinks and making sure people are looked after properly. I'm studying part-time at the moment, so I've got quite a flexible schedule and I'm available most afternoons and weekends. I'm a people person and I think I'd be good at making customers feel welcome and ensuring they have a nice experience.</p></div></div><div class='email-section'><div class='section-heading'>Action / Request</div><div class='section-content'><p>I'm confident with <span class='key-phrase'>dealing with people</span> and I enjoy working in busy environments. I can do <span class='key-phrase'>afternoons and all day Saturday</span>, and I could possibly do Sunday mornings too if you need me.</p><p><span class='polite key-phrase'>CV attached</span> — let me know if you need any other information. I'm free for an interview pretty much anytime this week or next if you'd like to meet up and have a chat about the role.</p></div></div><div class='email-section'><div class='section-heading'>Closing</div><div class='section-content'><p><span class='polite key-phrase'>Thanks!</span> Looking forward to hearing from you.</p><p><span class='polite key-phrase'>Cheers,</span><br/>[Your Name]</p></div></div>",

I did some delivery work for a local takeaway place a while back, so I know the area pretty well and I'm used to working to tight schedules and making sure orders get to people on time. I'm reliable, I don't mind working in all weathers, and I've got my own car which is in good condition. I'm also comfortable using navigation apps and I'm pretty tech-savvy generally, which I imagine helps with the job.</p></div></div><div class='email-section'><div class='section-heading'>Action / Request</div><div class='section-content'><p>I can work <span class='key-phrase'>weekday evenings and Sunday afternoons</span> and I've done <span class='key-phrase'>delivery driving</span> before so I know what the job involves.</p><p><span class='polite key-phrase'>My CV is attached</span> with all my details and my previous employer's contact info if you want to check my references.
