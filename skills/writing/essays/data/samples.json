      "fullText": "Over the past decade, there has been a significant rise in technology use across all age groups. Nowadays, there is increasing discussion about whether modern technology is creating a less sociable world. From my point of view, despite some benefits, technology is fundamentally reducing genuine human connection and making society more isolated.\n\nOn the one hand, supporters argue that online communication reduces face-to-face interaction. For example, many people now prefer texting or messaging rather than meeting friends in person. Consequently, social bonds have become weaker and more superficial. This is largely because screen-based interaction lacks the emotional depth and non-verbal cues essential for meaningful relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, another negative aspect is that technology creates serious distractions in educational settings. For instance, students constantly check social media during study time, leading to reduced focus and shallow learning. As a result, academic performance suffers despite having access to unlimited information. This happens because constant notifications interrupt concentration.\n\nIn addition to these issues, technology causes increased anxiety and mental health problems. The pressure to maintain an online presence and respond instantly to messages creates constant stress. Therefore, many people, especially young adults, report feeling overwhelmed and unable to disconnect from their devices.\n\nIn conclusion, although technology offers some communication benefits, it fundamentally makes society less sociable by replacing real interaction with screen-based contact. On balance, I believe this trend is deeply concerning for social wellbeing."

      "hook": "controversy_concern",
      "fullText": "One of the most controversial issues is whether technology is making society less sociable. In recent years, the topic of technology's impact on social interaction has attracted considerable attention. However, I firmly believe that technology enhances rather than reduces sociability by enabling new forms of connection that were previously impossible.\n\nFirstly, the main advantage of online communication is that it enables instant global connection across distances. For example, families separated by geography can maintain close relationships through video calls and messaging apps. Consequently, geographical barriers no longer prevent meaningful connections. This is because platforms like Zoom and WhatsApp have made international communication both affordable and accessible.\n\nSecondly, one positive aspect is that technology democratizes education by providing unlimited learning resources. For instance, students can access online courses, educational videos, and digital libraries regardless of their location. Therefore, learning opportunities have expanded dramatically beyond traditional classrooms. This can be attributed to the internet making knowledge available to anyone with connectivity.\n\nAlthough some people argue that technology isolates individuals, this view oversimplifies the issue. The reality is that technology changes HOW we communicate rather than reducing communication itself. For example, we may connect more frequently but perhaps less deeply. However, this represents different forms of sociability rather than less sociability.\n\nAll things considered, I am convinced that technology enhances social connection by providing new communication tools. While the nature of interaction may change, society is becoming more, not less, connected through technological advancement."

      "fullText": "There seems to be a belief that modern technology is harming face-to-face relationships. It is widely recognized that technology has transformed how people interact. While there are valid concerns about reduced face-to-face contact, I believe that technology creates different types of social interaction rather than making society fundamentally less sociable.\n\nOn the one hand, supporters argue that online communication enables unprecedented global connection. For example, professionals can collaborate across continents in real-time, and families maintain relationships despite geographic separation. Consequently, technology has expanded social networks beyond traditional limitations. This is largely because digital platforms provide affordable, instant communication tools.\n\nOn the other hand, critics believe that technology creates serious distractions, particularly in education. For instance, students multitask with social media during study time, leading to reduced concentration and shallow learning. As a result, despite having access to unlimited information, academic focus suffers. The reason for this is that constant notifications fragment attention.\n\nHowever, as far as I am concerned, the key issue is not whether technology makes us less sociable, but HOW we use it. When used mindfully, technology enhances connection; when used excessively, it isolates. A good illustration is scheduled video calls strengthening relationships, while constant scrolling replaces genuine interaction. Therefore, digital literacy is essential.\n\nAll things considered, technology's impact on sociability is complex rather than simply negative. Taking everything into account, I maintain that technology changes social interaction patterns but doesn't necessarily reduce overall sociability when used appropriately."

      "fullText": "Evidence indicates that urban traffic congestion has reached critical levels in major cities worldwide. One of the most serious problems facing society is traffic congestion in urban areas. This issue causes pollution, wastes time, and reduces quality of life. However, practical solutions exist that could significantly reduce this problem.\n\nThe main difficulty is the over-reliance on private vehicles. For example, in many cities, insufficient public transport means people have no choice but to drive to work. This has led to overcrowded roads during rush hours, with some commuters spending hours in traffic daily. The root cause is inadequate investment in public transport infrastructure over past decades.\n\nA pressing concern is the environmental impact of congestion. As a result of vehicles idling in traffic, air pollution has increased dramatically, causing respiratory problems and contributing to climate change. This problem arises because combustion engines produce harmful emissions when stationary.\n\nAn effective approach would be to invest heavily in public transport systems. By doing this, cities could provide reliable, affordable alternatives to driving. For instance, expanding metro networks and introducing dedicated bus lanes would encourage people to leave their cars at home. This measure would lead to fewer vehicles on roads and reduced emissions.\n\nAnother practical solution would be implementing congestion charging in city centers. This would help because it would discourage unnecessary car journeys while raising funds for transport improvements. To conclude, while traffic congestion is serious, a combination of better public transport and smart pricing policies could significantly improve the situation."

      "fullText": "Hardly a week goes by without another report of plastic pollution harming marine life. A major issue is the accumulation of plastic waste in our oceans. This critical problem threatens marine ecosystems and ultimately affects human health. Fortunately, several effective solutions could address this crisis.\n\nOne significant challenge is the widespread use of single-use plastics. For instance, plastic bags, bottles, and packaging are used briefly but persist in the environment for hundreds of years. The consequence of this is that millions of tons of plastic enter oceans annually, harming sea creatures and contaminating the food chain. This issue stems from our throwaway culture and inadequate recycling systems.\n\nThe impact of this problem is devastating. As a result of plastic pollution, marine animals mistake plastic for food or become entangled in waste, leading to injury and death. Furthermore, microplastics have now entered the human food supply through seafood. This creates difficulties such as potential health risks that are not yet fully understood.\n\nOne way to solve this is to ban single-use plastics and promote alternatives. The benefit of this approach is that it would drastically reduce the amount of plastic waste generated. For example, several countries have successfully implemented plastic bag bans, leading to significant reductions in pollution.\n\nAdditionally, investing in ocean cleanup technologies and improving waste management systems would be essential. In conclusion, while plastic pollution presents a serious threat, bans on single-use items combined with improved waste systems and cleanup efforts could effectively tackle this problem."

      "fullText": "In today's world, it is not uncommon to see people shopping online rather than visiting physical stores. Over the past decade, online shopping has increased dramatically, transforming the retail landscape. This essay will examine the causes and effects of this significant trend.\n\nThere are several reasons why online shopping has become so popular. One important cause is the convenience it offers busy consumers. For example, people can shop anytime, anywhere, without traveling to stores or waiting in queues. Another contributing factor is improved technology and internet access. Due to faster connections and user-friendly websites, the online shopping experience has become seamless and enjoyable.\n\nFurthermore, a major cause of this trend is competitive pricing online. Since online retailers have lower overhead costs than physical stores, they can offer better prices and frequent discounts. This can be attributed to not needing expensive high-street locations or large sales staff.\n\nThe impact of this shift has been substantial. One major effect is the decline of traditional retail stores, with many high-street shops closing permanently. As a consequence, jobs in physical retail have decreased significantly. This has resulted in changes to town centers, which now have more vacant properties.\n\nAnother significant effect is the growth of delivery services and warehouse employment. The outcome of this boom in online shopping has been increased demand for logistics workers and delivery drivers. Additionally, there has been a rise in packaging waste, creating environmental concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, online shopping has grown due to convenience, technology, and competitive pricing. This has led to major changes in retail employment patterns and environmental impacts."

      "fullText": "Statistics increasingly show that young people spend several hours daily on social media platforms. We are witnessing a growing trend in social media usage, particularly among teenagers and young adults. This phenomenon has multiple causes and far-reaching effects on individuals and society.\n\nThe primary reason for social media's popularity is the human need for connection and communication. For instance, these platforms allow young people to maintain friendships, share experiences, and feel part of a community. Since adolescence is a crucial period for social development, these tools fulfill an important psychological need. Another factor is the entertainment value social media provides through videos, memes, and interactive content.\n\nGiven that smartphones have become ubiquitous, accessing social media has never been easier. This technological accessibility is a key reason for increased usage. Furthermore, clever design features such as notifications and infinite scrolling are specifically created to keep users engaged for longer periods.\n\nThis trend has produced several significant effects. As a result of constant social media use, many young people experience anxiety and low self-esteem from comparing themselves to others' curated online personas. The consequence is that mental health issues among youth have increased in recent years. This has brought about growing concern among parents, educators, and health professionals.\n\nAnother important effect is reduced face-to-face social skills. Because much communication now happens through screens, some young people struggle with direct interpersonal interactions. This has given rise to concerns about future relationship-building abilities.\n\nTo sum up, social media popularity stems from social needs, entertainment value, and accessibility, but has led to both mental health challenges and changes in social behavior."

      "hook": "question",
      "fullText": "The question that remains unanswered is whether education should be treated as a right or a privilege. There is considerable debate about whether university education should be free for all students. Without doubt, I firmly believe that universities should be funded by the state and accessible to everyone regardless of financial background.\n\nThe most important reason is that education is a fundamental right, not a commodity. A good illustration is how free primary and secondary education is universally accepted as essential for society. Consider the case of Scandinavian countries, where free university education has led to highly educated populations and strong economies. This demonstrates that investment in education benefits entire societies, not just individuals.\n\nFurthermore, free university education would promote social equality and mobility. For instance, talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds often cannot afford tuition fees, preventing them from reaching their potential. As a result, society loses valuable skills and innovations. The advantage of free education is that it would ensure merit, not money, determines who receives higher education.\n\nAdmittedly, critics argue that free education would be too expensive for governments to fund. While it is true that costs would be substantial, I would argue that education is one of the most worthwhile investments a society can make. Moreover, educated citizens earn more and pay more taxes over their lifetimes, eventually recovering the cost.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that university education should be free because education is a right, and free access promotes equality while benefiting society as a whole through a more skilled workforce."

      "fullText": "One of the most controversial subjects is whether taxpayers should fund university education for all. Few issues have generated more controversy than the question of free university education. However, I strongly feel that students should contribute financially to their higher education rather than receiving it entirely free.\n\nThe fundamental reason is that those who benefit directly from university education should bear some cost. For example, university graduates typically earn significantly more over their lifetimes than non-graduates. It is clear that if education increases an individual's earning potential, they should invest in their own future. This is fair because taxpayers, including those who never attended university, would otherwise subsidize graduates' higher incomes.\n\nWhat is more, charging tuition fees helps maintain quality and prevent overcrowding. For instance, when education is entirely free, universities may become overwhelmed with students, leading to larger class sizes and reduced teaching quality. A compelling reason is that tuition fees provide essential funding for facilities, research, and qualified staff.\n\nAdditionally, free education might undervalue degrees and reduce students' commitment. Consider how people often value things more when they pay for them. As a result, students who contribute financially may take their studies more seriously and make better use of resources.\n\nAlthough some people argue that fees create inequality, I believe affordable student loans with income-based repayment schemes can address this concern. Such systems ensure that students from all backgrounds can access education while contributing fairly afterward.\n\nTo conclude, I maintain that students should help fund their university education because they benefit most directly, fees maintain quality, and loan systems can ensure fairness."

      "fullText": "Increasingly, the question is being asked: does money actually lead to happiness? Some people believe that money cannot buy happiness. However, I completely agree that money does contribute significantly to happiness and wellbeing.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that financial security brings peace of mind and happiness. For example, having sufficient money means not worrying about paying bills, affording healthcare, or providing for one's family. Consequently, this security reduces stress and anxiety, which are major barriers to happiness. This is evident in research showing that financial worries are among the leading causes of mental health problems.\n\nFurthermore, money enables people to enjoy experiences and pursue interests that bring joy. For instance, wealth allows travel, hobbies, education, and quality time with family. As a result, people can create meaningful memories and personal fulfillment. Take the case of someone who can afford to retire early and spend time with grandchildren—clearly money has enabled their happiness.\n\nAdmittedly, extremely wealthy people may not be proportionally happier, and money cannot solve all problems. However, this doesn't negate the fact that financial stability up to a comfortable level directly correlates with increased happiness. There is a good chance that most people's daily stresses would disappear with adequate financial resources.\n\nIn conclusion, I am in total agreement that money contributes to happiness. While money alone may not guarantee happiness, financial security provides the foundation for a less stressful, more fulfilling life with opportunities to pursue what truly matters."

      "fullText": "According to recent psychological research, happiness levels plateau above a certain income threshold. Many people claim that money brings happiness. I completely disagree with this view and believe that genuine happiness comes from relationships, purpose, and personal growth, not material wealth.\n\nI find this view unconvincing because numerous studies show that once basic needs are met, additional wealth has minimal impact on happiness. For example, lottery winners often report no long-term increase in happiness, and some become more unhappy due to relationship problems and loss of purpose. This demonstrates that money itself is not the source of genuine contentment.\n\nMoreover, the pursuit of wealth often damages what truly matters for happiness. For instance, people who prioritize earning money frequently sacrifice time with family and friends, work excessive hours damaging their health, and neglect personal relationships. As a result, despite accumulating wealth, they find themselves lonely and unfulfilled. This happens because they have neglected the fundamental human needs for connection and meaning.\n\nIt is true that poverty creates serious problems and lack of money can cause unhappiness. However, this does not mean that having more money creates happiness—it simply means that having enough money to meet basic needs prevents certain types of suffering.\n\nTo sum up, I strongly oppose the idea that money brings happiness. While financial security is important, authentic happiness stems from meaningful relationships, personal purpose, good health, and contributing to something larger than oneself. These cannot be purchased, regardless of wealth."
