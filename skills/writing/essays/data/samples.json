      "fullText": "Few issues have divided opinion as much as the enormous salaries paid to professional athletes. There has been heated discussion concerning whether famous sports people deserve such high wages. Without doubt, I firmly believe that sports stars are paid far too much money compared to people in other professions.\n\nFirstly, the main reason is that sports careers are relatively short compared to other jobs. For example, most professional athletes retire in their thirties, whereas doctors and teachers work until they are sixty-five. However, this does not justify earning millions in just a few years. This is because many other demanding careers also require years of training without receiving such rewards.\n\nSecondly, another significant point is that their salaries create unfair social values. For instance, a footballer can earn more in one week than a nurse earns in an entire year. As a result, young people may believe that entertainment is more valuable than essential services like healthcare or education. This happens because society pays excessive attention to sports while undervaluing crucial professions.\n\nAdmittedly, sports people do work hard and provide entertainment to millions. Nevertheless, I maintain that their contribution does not warrant such extreme pay. Consider the case of scientists who develop life-saving medicines—they rarely receive comparable recognition or compensation.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that famous sports people are paid too much. On balance, society should reconsider how it values different professions and ensure fairer distribution of wealth."

      "fullText": "It is widely recognized that professional athletes earn substantial salaries. Some people argue that famous sports people are paid too much money. However, I completely disagree with this view and believe their high earnings are justified by the entertainment value they provide and the short nature of their careers.\n\nTo begin with, the primary advantage is that sports stars generate enormous revenue for their organizations. For example, top footballers attract millions of viewers to matches, which creates income through ticket sales, merchandise, and broadcasting rights. Consequently, it is fair that athletes receive a significant share of the profits they help create. This is largely because their unique talents drive the entire sports industry.\n\nFurthermore, one important factor is that professional athletes have very limited career spans. For instance, most sports people must retire in their early thirties due to physical demands and injury risks. Therefore, they need to earn enough during these few years to support themselves for the rest of their lives. This can be attributed to the intense physical strain that makes long careers impossible.\n\nAlthough critics claim this money could be better spent elsewhere, I would argue that sports provide valuable entertainment and inspire millions. Take the case of Olympic athletes who motivate young people to pursue healthy, active lifestyles.\n\nTo sum up, I strongly feel that sports people deserve their high salaries given the revenue they generate and their short careers."

      "fullText": "In today's world, it is not uncommon to see advertisements everywhere we look. There is considerable debate about whether advertising benefits society. From my perspective, I firmly believe that advertising is generally positive for society because it keeps people informed and encourages healthy competition.\n\nFirst and foremost, the key advantage is that advertising helps consumers make informed decisions. For example, when companies advertise their products, people can compare features, prices, and quality before purchasing. As a result, consumers have access to information that helps them choose the best options for their needs. This is because modern advertising must be truthful and provide accurate product details.\n\nIn addition, another important benefit is that advertising encourages competition between companies. For instance, when businesses compete for customers through advertising, they are motivated to improve quality and reduce prices. Consequently, consumers receive better products at lower costs. This happens because companies must differentiate themselves from competitors to attract buyers.\n\nAdmittedly, some advertisements can be misleading or promote unnecessary consumption. Having said that, regulations exist to prevent false advertising, and consumers can choose to ignore persuasive messages. Consider how advertising also supports free media by providing funding for newspapers, websites, and television programs.\n\nAll things considered, I am convinced that advertising brings more benefits than drawbacks to society. Overall, it serves as a valuable tool for information and economic growth."

      "hook": "concern",
      "fullText": "Growing anxiety surrounds the problem of advertising's influence on modern society. Many experts are increasingly worried that advertising creates more problems than benefits. I strongly disagree with the view that advertising is good for society because it manipulates consumers and promotes wasteful consumption.\n\nThe most important reason is that advertising often manipulates people's emotions rather than providing genuine information. For example, advertisements frequently create artificial needs by suggesting that products will make people happier, more attractive, or more successful. This leads to unnecessary spending on items people do not actually need. This is largely because advertisers employ psychological techniques designed to influence behavior.\n\nWhat is more, a pressing concern is that advertising encourages excessive consumerism and waste. For instance, fashion companies constantly advertise new trends to convince people their current clothes are outdated. As a consequence, massive amounts of perfectly good items are discarded, creating environmental damage. The root cause is that advertising prioritizes profit over sustainability.\n\nWhile supporters argue that advertising informs consumers about choices, I find this view unconvincing. In reality, most advertisements focus on persuasion rather than education. Take the case of junk food marketing, which rarely mentions health risks while emphasizing taste and pleasure.\n\nIn conclusion, I maintain that advertising has a predominantly negative effect on society. Taking everything into account, it promotes unsustainable consumption patterns and manipulates consumer behavior."

      "title": "Long-Lasting Products (AGREE - Good Thing)",
      "position": "agree",
      "wordCount": 222,
      "hook": "reference",
      "fullText": "Recent studies have shown that products are being replaced more frequently than ever before. The question that remains unanswered is whether products that last a long time benefit society. Without doubt, I believe that long-lasting products are extremely positive because they protect the environment and provide better value for consumers.\n\nFirstly, the fundamental reason is that durable products significantly reduce environmental damage. For example, when items like phones or appliances last for many years instead of just months, fewer resources are needed for manufacturing replacements. Therefore, this reduces pollution, energy consumption, and waste in landfills. This is because producing new items requires mining raw materials, factory production, and transportation—all of which harm the environment.\n\nSecondly, another compelling advantage is that long-lasting products offer better economic value for consumers. For instance, buying a high-quality washing machine that functions for fifteen years costs less overall than replacing cheap models every two years. As a result, families save money in the long term despite higher initial costs. This happens because quality construction and materials ensure products remain functional longer.\n\nSome people argue that changing technology makes old products obsolete. However, I would argue that basic functionality often remains useful for years. Consider how many people successfully use computers and phones for five years or more.\n\nTo conclude, I am firmly convinced that long-lasting products benefit both the environment and consumers. In the final analysis, society should prioritize durability over disposable consumption."

      "fullText": "Despite the many advantages of durable products, there are also serious drawbacks to consider. It is often said that long-lasting products are always beneficial. While I acknowledge certain benefits, I believe the answer depends on the type of product and current circumstances.\n\nOn the one hand, the main advantage is that long-lasting products reduce environmental waste. For example, furniture, kitchen appliances, and tools that last decades prevent countless items from ending up in landfills. Consequently, this approach conserves natural resources and reduces pollution. This is largely because manufacturing fewer replacement products means less energy consumption and fewer carbon emissions.\n\nOn the other hand, a significant disadvantage is that rapidly changing technology can make old products inefficient. For instance, air conditioners and refrigerators from twenty years ago consume far more electricity than modern energy-efficient models. As a result, keeping old appliances actually harms the environment despite reducing waste. This can be attributed to technological advances that dramatically improve efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, in terms of fashion and personal items, long-lasting products may not suit changing trends. Consider how clothing styles evolve—people naturally want variety rather than wearing identical items for years. This demonstrates that product longevity depends on context.\n\nAll things considered, I maintain that durability is beneficial for basic necessities but less important for technology and fashion. Taking everything into account, the ideal approach balances longevity with reasonable upgrades when significant improvements exist."

      "hook": "question",
      "fullText": "How concerned should we be about helping others in our community? Increasingly, the question is being asked whether everyone should regularly help other people. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement because helping others strengthens communities and provides personal fulfillment.\n\nFirst of all, the most important factor is that regular acts of kindness create stronger, more connected communities. For example, when neighbors help elderly residents with shopping or young parents assist at local schools, these actions build trust and social bonds. As a result, communities become safer, friendlier places where people support each other during difficult times. This is because consistent helping behavior creates a culture of mutual assistance.\n\nIn addition, another significant benefit is that helping others contributes to personal wellbeing and happiness. For instance, research consistently shows that volunteers report higher life satisfaction and better mental health than those who never help others. Therefore, giving something back to society actually benefits the helper as much as those receiving assistance. This happens because helping others provides a sense of purpose and connection.\n\nWhile some people argue they lack time for regular volunteering, I believe even small acts matter. Consider how spending just one hour weekly at a food bank or visiting isolated elderly neighbors creates meaningful impact.\n\nIn conclusion, I am in total agreement that everyone should do something regularly to help others. This essay has examined how helping behavior benefits both communities and individuals."

      "hook": "controversy",
      "fullText": "One of the most controversial subjects is whether sports should be compulsory in schools. Still the subject of bitter debate is the issue of mandatory physical education. I completely disagree that all students should have to do sport at school because this approach ignores individual differences and can create negative experiences.\n\nThe primary reason is that forcing reluctant students to participate often creates lasting negative associations with physical activity. For example, students who lack natural athletic ability may feel humiliated during competitive sports, leading them to avoid all exercise in adulthood. This results in exactly the opposite outcome that schools intend to achieve. This is because negative experiences during formative years shape lifelong attitudes toward fitness.\n\nWhat is more, a crucial consideration is that students have diverse interests and strengths. For instance, some young people excel in music, art, or academics rather than sports. Consequently, mandatory sports programs may waste valuable time these students could spend developing their actual talents. This happens because education should nurture individual abilities rather than impose uniform requirements.\n\nAlthough physical health is important, I would argue that schools should offer varied options including dance, yoga, hiking, or swimming rather than just traditional sports. Take the case of students with physical disabilities who need adapted activities.\n\nTo sum up, I strongly oppose making sports mandatory for all students. Instead, schools should provide diverse physical activities that accommodate different interests and abilities."

      "hook": "concern",
      "fullText": "Serious concerns are being expressed about advertising targeted at young children. Alarm bells are ringing over the effects of commercial marketing on childhood development. Without question, I firmly believe that advertisements aimed at children should not be allowed because they manipulate vulnerable minds and encourage unhealthy habits.\n\nFirstly, the fundamental problem is that young children cannot distinguish between entertainment and persuasive marketing. For example, colorful cartoon characters promoting sugary cereals appear to children as fun friends rather than sales tactics. As a result, children pester parents to buy products without understanding they are being manipulated. This is largely because children under eight lack the cognitive development to recognize advertising intent.\n\nSecondly, another pressing concern is that child-directed advertising promotes unhealthy consumption patterns. For instance, companies heavily market junk food, sugary drinks, and plastic toys to children through television and online platforms. Consequently, childhood obesity rates and excessive materialism have increased dramatically. This can be attributed to constant exposure to messages encouraging poor dietary choices and demanding the latest products.\n\nSome people argue that parents should simply say no to children's requests. Nevertheless, this ignores the reality that advertising creates enormous pressure on families. Consider how children may feel excluded if they lack products their peers possess.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that advertising to children should be banned. After examining the evidence, the psychological manipulation and health consequences clearly outweigh any minor benefits."

      "hook": "trend_generalisation",
      "fullText": "There seems to be a belief that self-employment offers the perfect work lifestyle. Increasingly, more people today seem to consider starting their own businesses. However, after weighing both sides carefully, I believe that working for somebody else generally provides greater security and stability, despite certain advantages of self-employment.\n\nOn the one hand, the main advantage of self-employment is the independence and flexibility it offers. For example, self-employed individuals can set their own schedules, choose their clients, and make all business decisions without consulting others. Consequently, many people find this autonomy extremely satisfying and motivating. This is largely because they maintain complete control over their professional lives.\n\nOn the other hand, a significant disadvantage is the lack of job security that comes with self-employment. For instance, self-employed people face unpredictable income, no guaranteed salary during slow periods, and no employer benefits like health insurance or pensions. As a result, financial stress becomes a constant concern. This happens because business success depends on numerous external factors beyond individual control.\n\nFurthermore, working for an employer provides valuable structure and support. Consider how employees receive regular training, work alongside experienced colleagues, and have clear career progression paths. These benefits help professional development in ways self-employment often cannot match.\n\nAll things considered, while I acknowledge the appeal of independence, I believe working for somebody else offers more advantages for most people. Taking everything into account, the security and benefits of traditional employment outweigh the flexibility of self-employment for the majority."

      "fullText": "According to recent surveys, satisfaction levels among self-employed workers exceed those of traditional employees. There has been considerable debate about whether self-employment or working for others provides a better career path. Although both options have merit, I lean towards believing that self-employment offers greater long-term fulfillment despite its challenges.\n\nFirstly, one significant benefit of self-employment is the potential for unlimited earning capacity. For example, while employees typically have fixed salaries regardless of effort, self-employed individuals directly benefit from their success and hard work. Therefore, those with strong motivation and skills can achieve far greater financial rewards. This is because there is no salary ceiling limiting their income.\n\nSecondly, another important advantage is the opportunity to pursue genuine passion and interests. For instance, self-employed people can focus on work they find meaningful rather than following corporate directives. As a result, many report higher job satisfaction and personal fulfillment. This stems from the ability to align work with personal values.\n\nAdmittedly, working for an employer provides greater security and stability. Nevertheless, I would argue that this security often comes at the cost of limited growth and autonomy. Consider how many employees feel trapped in unfulfilling jobs due to financial obligations.\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the risks involved, I believe self-employment offers more advantages for those willing to accept uncertainty. On balance, the freedom and potential rewards make it the better option for ambitious individuals."

      "fullText": "It is common knowledge that family structures vary greatly across different cultures and societies. Few people would disagree that family size significantly impacts children's development. This essay will argue that both large and small families offer distinct advantages, and the ideal choice depends on individual circumstances rather than following a universal rule.\n\nOn the one hand, the key advantage of large families is the social learning opportunities they provide. For example, children with multiple siblings naturally develop strong communication skills, learn to share resources, and understand cooperation through daily interactions. Consequently, they often possess excellent social abilities that benefit them throughout life. This is largely because large families create constant opportunities for negotiation and compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, a significant benefit of small families is the greater individual attention each child receives. For instance, parents with one or two children can dedicate more time, financial resources, and emotional support to each child's specific needs and interests. As a result, children in small families may receive superior educational opportunities and personalized guidance. This happens because parents can focus intensively on each child's development.\n\nHowever, I maintain that financial circumstances matter more than size. Consider how a wealthy large family might provide better opportunities than a struggling small family.\n\nAll things considered, I believe both family structures have value. Taking everything into account, factors like parental involvement, financial stability, and emotional support matter more than the number of siblings."
