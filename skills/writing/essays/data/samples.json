      "fullText": "Despite nostalgia for simpler times, life today is undeniably superior to life a century ago. While some romanticize the past, I firmly believe that modern life offers far greater quality, opportunities, and comfort than our ancestors could have imagined.\n\nFirst and foremost, healthcare advances have revolutionized human wellbeing. This is largely because modern medicine can now prevent and cure diseases that once killed millions. For example, vaccines have eliminated threats like smallpox and polio, while antibiotics treat infections that were previously fatal. As a result, average life expectancy has increased by 30-40 years globally. This dramatic improvement in health alone makes contemporary life incomparably better.\n\nFurthermore, entertainment and communication have been transformed by technology. For instance, streaming services provide unlimited access to films, music, and shows from around the world, while social media enables instant connection with friends and family anywhere. Consequently, people today enjoy richer cultural experiences and maintain relationships that distance once made impossible. This can be attributed to digital innovation that has democratized access to information and entertainment.\n\nAdmittedly, modern life brings stress and environmental challenges. However, I would argue that the benefits of advanced healthcare, technology, and opportunities vastly outweigh these concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that life today is significantly better than a century ago. Taking everything into account, progress in health, communication, and quality of life represents genuine improvement for humanity."

      "fullText": "Growing anxiety surrounds the impact of the fashion industry on modern society. Many experts are increasingly worried that fashion creates more harm than benefit. I strongly agree that the fashion industry has a predominantly negative effect on people's lives because it promotes unrealistic beauty standards and encourages wasteful consumption.\n\nThe primary reason is that fashion advertising creates impossible beauty ideals that damage self-esteem. For example, fashion magazines and advertisements feature heavily edited images of models with unrealistic body types. This leads to widespread dissatisfaction with appearance, particularly among young people who compare themselves to these artificial standards. This happens because constant exposure to idealized images makes ordinary appearance seem inadequate.\n\nWhat is more, the fashion industry drives excessive consumerism and environmental damage. For instance, fast fashion companies release new collections every few weeks, convincing consumers their current clothes are outdated. As a consequence, millions of tons of perfectly wearable clothing end up in landfills annually while factory production pollutes water and air. The root cause is that fashion prioritizes profit over sustainability and wellbeing.\n\nWhile supporters claim fashion allows self-expression, I find this argument weak. Consider how most people follow trends rather than developing genuine personal style, suggesting fashion actually limits creativity.\n\nIn conclusion, I maintain that the fashion industry's negative impacts outweigh any benefits. After examining the evidence, the psychological damage and environmental destruction caused by fashion are too significant to ignore."

      "fullText": "In today's world, it is not uncommon to see people learning multiple languages throughout their lives. There seems to be a growing belief that language learning offers benefits beyond academic requirements. I wholeheartedly agree that there are far more compelling reasons to learn foreign languages than simply passing tests.\n\nFirst of all, learning languages opens doors to rich cultural experiences and deeper understanding. For example, speaking French allows appreciation of French literature in its original form, while knowing Spanish enables genuine connection with Spanish-speaking communities. Therefore, language learning enriches life in ways that test preparation alone never could. This is largely because languages provide access to entirely different worldviews and cultural traditions.\n\nMoreover, language skills create significant career advantages in our globalized economy. For instance, multinational companies actively seek employees who can communicate with international clients and partners. As a result, bilingual workers often earn higher salaries and have access to positions unavailable to monolingual candidates. This stems from the practical value that language abilities provide in professional contexts.\n\nWhile tests provide useful structure and motivation, I would argue they represent just the beginning. Consider how true language mastery develops through actual communication, travel, and cultural immersion rather than exam preparation.\n\nAll things considered, I am convinced that language learning offers profound personal and professional benefits. Taking everything into account, the ability to connect across cultures and access diverse perspectives far exceeds the value of any test score."

From my perspective, I firmly believe that learning one's own country's history is essential because it builds national identity and helps citizens learn from past mistakes.\n\nTo begin with, studying national history creates shared identity and social cohesion. For example, understanding key historical events, struggles, and achievements gives citizens common cultural reference points. Consequently, this shared knowledge helps unite diverse populations and strengthens social bonds. This is because collective historical memory provides the foundation for community and national identity.\n\nIn addition, history teaches crucial lessons that help societies avoid repeating errors. For instance, studying past conflicts, economic crises, or social injustices reveals patterns and consequences that inform current decision-making. As a result, historically informed citizens can recognize warning signs and make wiser choices. This happens because understanding cause and effect in historical contexts develops critical thinking applicable to present challenges.\n\nAlthough some argue that focusing on the future matters more, I would counter that we cannot navigate forward effectively without understanding where we came from. Consider how countries that ignore their history often repeat the same mistakes.\n\nTo sum up, I strongly feel that everyone should learn their country's history. Overall, historical knowledge creates informed citizens capable of building better futures based on past experiences."

      "fullText": "It is widely recognized that thousands of species face extinction due to human activity. There is considerable debate about whether we should invest heavily in protecting endangered animals. From my perspective, I completely agree that we must do everything possible to save species from extinction because biodiversity is essential for ecosystem survival and humans bear responsibility for the crisis.\n\nFirst and foremost, every species plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance. For example, bees pollinate crops that feed billions of people, while predators like wolves control prey populations and prevent overgrazing. Consequently, losing species creates cascading effects that ultimately threaten human survival and food security. This is largely because ecosystems function as interconnected webs where each species contributes to overall stability.\n\nIn addition, humans have caused most modern extinctions through habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. For instance, industrial activity has destroyed rainforests and coral reefs while poisoning oceans with plastic. As a result, we have a moral obligation to reverse damage we have created. This can be attributed to our unique capacity as a species to either destroy or protect other life forms.\n\nWhile critics argue conservation is expensive, I would argue that ecosystem collapse would cost humanity far more.\n\nTo sum up, I strongly believe we must prioritize saving endangered species. Overall, protecting biodiversity is protecting our own survival."

      "fullText": "It is widely recognized that professional athletes earn substantial salaries. Some people argue that famous sports people are paid too much money. However, I completely disagree with this view and believe their high earnings are justified by the entertainment value they provide and the short nature of their careers.\n\nTo begin with, the primary advantage is that sports stars generate enormous revenue for their organizations. For example, top footballers attract millions of viewers to matches, which creates income through ticket sales, merchandise, and broadcasting rights. Consequently, it is fair that athletes receive a significant share of the profits they help create. This is largely because their unique talents drive the entire sports industry.\n\nFurthermore, one important factor is that professional athletes have very limited career spans. For instance, most sports people must retire in their early thirties due to physical demands and injury risks. Therefore, they need to earn enough during these few years to support themselves for the rest of their lives. This can be attributed to the intense physical strain that makes long careers impossible.\n\nAlthough critics claim this money could be better spent elsewhere, I would argue that sports provide valuable entertainment and inspire millions. Take the case of Olympic athletes who motivate young people to pursue healthy, active lifestyles.\n\nTo sum up, I strongly feel that sports people deserve their high salaries given the revenue they generate and their short careers."

I strongly disagree with the view that advertising is good for society because it manipulates consumers and promotes wasteful consumption.\n\nThe most important reason is that advertising often manipulates people's emotions rather than providing genuine information. For example, advertisements frequently create artificial needs by suggesting that products will make people happier, more attractive, or more successful. This leads to unnecessary spending on items people do not actually need. This is largely because advertisers employ psychological techniques designed to influence behavior.\n\nWhat is more, a pressing concern is that advertising encourages excessive consumerism and waste.

As a consequence, massive amounts of perfectly good items are discarded, creating environmental damage. The root cause is that advertising prioritizes profit over sustainability.\n\nWhile supporters argue that advertising informs consumers about choices, I find this view unconvincing. In reality, most advertisements focus on persuasion rather than education. Take the case of junk food marketing, which rarely mentions health risks while emphasizing taste and pleasure.\n\nIn conclusion, I maintain that advertising has a predominantly negative effect on society.

      "hook": "reference",
      "fullText": "Recent studies have shown that products are being replaced more frequently than ever before. The question that remains unanswered is whether products that last a long time benefit society. Without doubt, I believe that long-lasting products are extremely positive because they protect the environment and provide better value for consumers.\n\nFirstly, the fundamental reason is that durable products significantly reduce environmental damage. For example, when items like phones or appliances last for many years instead of just months, fewer resources are needed for manufacturing replacements. Therefore, this reduces pollution, energy consumption, and waste in landfills. This is because producing new items requires mining raw materials, factory production, and transportation—all of which harm the environment.\n\nSecondly, another compelling advantage is that long-lasting products offer better economic value for consumers. For instance, buying a high-quality washing machine that functions for fifteen years costs less overall than replacing cheap models every two years. As a result, families save money in the long term despite higher initial costs. This happens because quality construction and materials ensure products remain functional longer.\n\nSome people argue that changing technology makes old products obsolete. However, I would argue that basic functionality often remains useful for years. Consider how many people successfully use computers and phones for five years or more.\n\nTo conclude, I am firmly convinced that long-lasting products benefit both the environment and consumers. In the final analysis, society should prioritize durability over disposable consumption."

      "fullText": "How concerned should we be about helping others in our community? Increasingly, the question is being asked whether everyone should regularly help other people. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement because helping others strengthens communities and provides personal fulfillment.\n\nFirst of all, the most important factor is that regular acts of kindness create stronger, more connected communities. For example, when neighbors help elderly residents with shopping or young parents assist at local schools, these actions build trust and social bonds. As a result, communities become safer, friendlier places where people support each other during difficult times. This is because consistent helping behavior creates a culture of mutual assistance.\n\nIn addition, another significant benefit is that helping others contributes to personal wellbeing and happiness. For instance, research consistently shows that volunteers report higher life satisfaction and better mental health than those who never help others. Therefore, giving something back to society actually benefits the helper as much as those receiving assistance. This happens because helping others provides a sense of purpose and connection.\n\nWhile some people argue they lack time for regular volunteering, I believe even small acts matter. Consider how spending just one hour weekly at a food bank or visiting isolated elderly neighbors creates meaningful impact.\n\nIn conclusion, I am in total agreement that everyone should do something regularly to help others. This essay has examined how helping behavior benefits both communities and individuals."

      "fullText": "One of the most controversial subjects is whether sports should be compulsory in schools. Still the subject of bitter debate is the issue of mandatory physical education. While I acknowledge the health benefits of physical activity, I disagree that all students should be forced to participate in traditional sports because this approach ignores individual differences and can create lasting negative associations with exercise.\n\nOn the one hand, physical activity is undeniably important for health and development. For example, regular exercise prevents obesity, strengthens bones and muscles, and improves mental wellbeing. Consequently, schools have a responsibility to promote active lifestyles. This is largely because childhood habits often continue into adulthood, making early exposure to physical activity crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, mandatory competitive sports often alienate students who lack natural athletic ability. For instance, students who struggle with team sports may feel humiliated during games, leading them to avoid all exercise in adulthood. As a result, forced participation can create exactly the opposite outcome that schools intend. This happens because negative experiences during formative years shape lifelong attitudes toward fitness.\n\nFurthermore, schools should offer diverse physical activities rather than just traditional sports. Consider how yoga, dance, hiking, swimming, or martial arts might appeal to students who dislike competitive team games.\n\nAll things considered, I maintain that physical education should be required but not limited to conventional sports. Taking everything into account, offering varied activities that accommodate different interests and abilities serves students better than mandatory traditional sports."

      "fullText": "Serious concerns are being expressed about advertising targeted at young children. Alarm bells are ringing over the effects of commercial marketing on childhood development. Without question, I firmly believe that advertisements aimed at children should not be allowed because they manipulate vulnerable minds and encourage unhealthy habits.\n\nFirstly, the fundamental problem is that young children cannot distinguish between entertainment and persuasive marketing. For example, colorful cartoon characters promoting sugary cereals appear to children as fun friends rather than sales tactics. As a result, children pester parents to buy products without understanding they are being manipulated. This is largely because children under eight lack the cognitive development to recognize advertising intent.\n\nSecondly, another pressing concern is that child-directed advertising promotes unhealthy consumption patterns. For instance, companies heavily market junk food, sugary drinks, and plastic toys to children through television and online platforms. Consequently, childhood obesity rates and excessive materialism have increased dramatically. This can be attributed to constant exposure to messages encouraging poor dietary choices and demanding the latest products.\n\nSome people argue that parents should simply say no to children's requests. Nevertheless, this ignores the reality that advertising creates enormous pressure on families. Consider how children may feel excluded if they lack products their peers possess.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that advertising to children should be banned. After examining the evidence, the psychological manipulation and health consequences clearly outweigh any minor benefits."

      "fullText": "A widely-discussed issue these days is that environmental pollution threatens our planet's future. There are fears that damage may be irreversible. However, despite the severity of environmental problems, I firmly believe these issues can be solved through a combination of technological innovation, government action, and individual responsibility.\n\nTo begin with, sustainable transportation can dramatically reduce air pollution. This is because vehicle emissions constitute a major source of urban pollution. For example, electric vehicles produce zero direct emissions, while improved public transport systems reduce the number of cars on roads. Consequently, cities investing in green transport see significant air quality improvements. This demonstrates that practical solutions already exist and work effectively.\n\nFurthermore, protecting waterways requires both regulation and innovation. For instance, banning single-use plastics prevents millions of tons of waste from entering oceans, while new filtration technologies can clean polluted rivers. As a result, countries implementing strict environmental laws have successfully restored damaged ecosystems. This happens because combining prevention with remediation addresses both current damage and future pollution.\n\nMoreover, renewable energy transition offers hope for reducing industrial pollution. Consider how solar and wind power have become cost-competitive with fossil fuels, making clean energy economically viable. This trend will accelerate as technology improves.\n\nWhile challenges are serious, I remain optimistic. In conclusion, I am convinced that environmental problems can be solved if governments, businesses, and individuals commit to necessary changes. Taking everything into account, we possess both the technology and knowledge to create a sustainable future—what we need now is collective will to act."

This question increasingly confronts workers choosing between well-paid but unfulfilling jobs and passionate work with modest compensation. After careful consideration, I believe the ideal lies in balancing adequate income with meaningful work, though circumstances determine which should take priority.\n\nOn the one hand, financial security provides essential stability for wellbeing. For example, adequate income ensures quality housing, healthcare, children's education, and retirement savings. Consequently, financial stress diminishes when basic needs are comfortably met. This is because monetary anxiety severely impacts mental health and life satisfaction, making some level of financial comfort crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, job satisfaction is vital for daily happiness. For instance, we spend over 90,000 hours at work during our careers – more than any other activity except sleep. As a result, finding meaning and enjoyment in work becomes essential for overall life quality. This stems from the fact that unfulfilling work, regardless of pay, can lead to depression and burnout.\n\nFurthermore, individual circumstances matter greatly. Consider how a single parent must prioritize income to support children, while someone without dependents can more easily pursue passion over payment.\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging both perspectives, I believe most people need adequate income for security while seeking reasonable enjoyment in their work.

There has been heated discussion concerning whether digital communication makes us less sociable. However, I completely disagree with this view and believe technology actually enhances our social lives by enabling more diverse and frequent connections.\n\nFirstly, technology allows us to maintain relationships across distances that would otherwise be impossible. For example, video calls enable families separated by continents to see each other regularly, while messaging apps keep friends connected despite busy schedules. Therefore, technology expands rather than limits our social circles. This is largely because digital tools overcome physical barriers that previously ended or weakened many relationships.\n\nSecondly, online platforms create new communities based on shared interests rather than just geography. For instance, people with rare hobbies or conditions can find supportive communities online that don't exist in their local areas. As a result, many individuals develop meaningful friendships through shared online experiences. This can be attributed to technology's ability to connect people who would never meet otherwise.\n\nFurthermore, social skills adapt rather than disappear with technology. Consider how young people today communicate constantly through multiple channels, developing new forms of social intelligence suited to digital environments.\n\nAdmittedly, face-to-face interaction remains valuable.

There has been considerable debate about whether digital shopping surpasses traditional stores. After weighing both perspectives, I believe online shopping offers significant advantages but cannot entirely replace physical retail, as each serves different needs.\n\nOn the one hand, online shopping provides unmatched convenience and variety. For example, consumers can compare prices across dozens of retailers instantly, shop at any time, and access products unavailable locally. Consequently, online platforms save substantial time and often money. This is because digital retail eliminates geographic limitations and reduces overhead costs passed to consumers.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional shopping offers essential experiences that online cannot replicate. For instance, customers need to try clothes for fit, test electronics before purchasing, or receive immediate expert advice from staff. As a result, physical stores remain crucial for products requiring sensory evaluation or immediate need. This stems from the tangible nature of shopping that digital experiences cannot fully capture.\n\nFurthermore, the ideal approach often combines both methods. Consider how shoppers frequently research products online but make final purchases in stores, or vice versa, using each channel's strengths.\n\nAll things considered, I maintain that neither method is universally superior.

However, after weighing both sides carefully, I believe that working for somebody else generally provides greater security and stability, despite certain advantages of self-employment.\n\nOn the one hand, the main advantage of self-employment is the independence and flexibility it offers. For example, self-employed individuals can set their own schedules, choose their clients, and make all business decisions without consulting others. Consequently, many people find this autonomy extremely satisfying and motivating. This is largely because they maintain complete control over their professional lives.\n\nOn the other hand, a significant disadvantage is the lack of job security that comes with self-employment. For instance, self-employed people face unpredictable income, no guaranteed salary during slow periods, and no employer benefits like health insurance or pensions. As a result, financial stress becomes a constant concern. This happens because business success depends on numerous external factors beyond individual control.\n\nFurthermore, working for an employer provides valuable structure and support. Consider how employees receive regular training, work alongside experienced colleagues, and have clear career progression paths. These benefits help professional development in ways self-employment often cannot match.\n\nAll things considered, while I acknowledge the appeal of independence, I believe working for somebody else offers more advantages for most people.

While I acknowledge that both relationships provide value, I lean towards believing that family relationships are ultimately more important because they offer unconditional support and lifelong stability that friendships rarely match.\n\nFirstly, family bonds are permanent and unconditional in ways friendships typically are not. For example, parents continue loving and supporting children through failures, poor decisions, and life changes that might end friendships. Therefore, family provides a foundation of acceptance that remains constant regardless of circumstances. This is because family relationships are based on permanent bonds rather than shared interests or convenience.\n\nSecondly, family typically provides more substantial practical support during crises. For instance, parents help adult children with housing deposits, medical emergencies, and childcare in ways friends cannot or will not. As a result, family offers tangible assistance that exceeds what most friendships provide. This can be attributed to family members feeling obligated to help in ways friends do not.\n\nAdmittedly, friends understand current life situations better and share interests more naturally. Nevertheless, I would argue that this situational compatibility matters less than permanent, unconditional family support.\n\nIn conclusion, while both relationships have value, I believe family ultimately matters more.

For example, children with multiple siblings naturally develop strong communication skills, learn to share resources, and understand cooperation through daily interactions. Consequently, they often possess excellent social abilities that benefit them throughout life. This is largely because large families create constant opportunities for negotiation and compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, a significant benefit of small families is the greater individual attention each child receives. For instance, parents with one or two children can dedicate more time, financial resources, and emotional support to each child's specific needs and interests. As a result, children in small families may receive superior educational opportunities and personalized guidance. This happens because parents can focus intensively on each child's development.\n\nHowever, I maintain that financial circumstances matter more than size. Consider how a wealthy large family might provide better opportunities than a struggling small family.\n\nAll things considered, I believe both family structures have value.
