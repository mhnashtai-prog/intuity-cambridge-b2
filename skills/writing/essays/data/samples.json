  "question": "Do you agree that working from home is better than working in an office?",
  "writingPoints": ["time saving", "comfort", "social interaction (your own idea)"],
  "answer": "<p><span class='discourse'>Nowadays</span>, working from home has become increasingly common. <span class='discourse'>It is widely argued that</span> remote work plays an important role in modern society. <span class='discourse'>Many people believe</span> that working from home is better, while others hold the opposite view. <span class='discourse'>Therefore, it is important to examine arguments both in favour of and against</span> this trend.</p><p><span class='discourse'>One strong argument in favour of</span> working from home is that it saves time. <span class='causal'>A major reason why many people agree with</span> remote work is that it removes commuting. <span class='discourse'>For example</span>, employees can save two hours every day. <span class='causal'>As a result</span>, they feel less tired and more productive. <span class='opinion'>Many believe that</span> this contributes positively to work-life balance.</p><p><span class='discourse'>Another point supporting</span> working from home is that it offers greater comfort. <span class='causal'>A further justification is that</span> people can create their own workspace. <span class='discourse'>For instance</span>, workers can adjust temperature and lighting to suit their needs. <span class='causal'>Consequently</span>, they feel more relaxed and focused. This shows why remote work helps productivity.</p><p><span class='discourse'>On the other hand, critics argue that</span> working from home can lead to isolation. <span class='opinion'>However, many people oppose</span> remote work because it may reduce social interaction. <span class='discourse'>For example</span>, office workers build friendships through daily contact. <span class='causal'>As a result</span>, they feel more connected to their company. <span class='opinion'>Opponents often point out that</span> remote work tends to weaken teamwork. <span class='opinion'>A key argument against</span> working from home is that it affects communication negatively.</p><p><span class='discourse'>In conclusion, although there are strong arguments on both sides</span>, <span class='opinion'>I firmly believe that</span> working from home is generally better. <span class='opinion'>While</span> offices support social contact, the evidence strongly supports remote work for saving time and improving comfort. <span class='discourse'>Overall, the arguments in favour of</span> working from home seem far more convincing than those against it. <span class='opinion'>On balance, it appears that</span> remote work brings more advantages than disadvantages.</p>"
