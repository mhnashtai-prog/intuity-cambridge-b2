        "personal": "<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Introduction</div><div class='section-content'><span class='discourse'>When the principal asked me to</span> assess our school facilities, I knew exactly where to start - I've been frustrated by some of these issues for months. After surveying 215 classmates, I discovered my concerns were widely shared. This report covers the facilities that matter most to students' daily experience.</div></div>\n\n<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Current Situation</div><div class='section-content'>Our classrooms make me feel proud - they're modern, clean, with technology that actually works. The new interactive boards have <span class='vocabulary'>transformed</span> how teachers present lessons. <span class='discourse'>However</span>, the library tells a different story. <span class='discourse'>Last week during exam revision</span>, I watched classmates searching desperately for seats, some ending up on the floor. The sports hall serves us well, but walking into the toilets feels like stepping back twenty years.</div></div>\n\n<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Problems Identified</div><div class='section-content'>The library situation <span class='vocabulary'>breaks my heart</span>. We're told education matters, yet we can't find space to study. <span class='discourse'>During exam periods</span>, the scramble for seats creates stress before we've even opened a book. The toilet facilities embarrass me when showing visitors around - they're outdated and sometimes unhygienic. <span class='discourse'>Then there's</span> the Wi-Fi issue: trying to research in certain building areas means watching that endless loading circle, <span class='discourse'>which wastes</span> precious study time.</div></div>\n\n<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Recommendations</div><div class='section-content'><span class='recommend'>My strongest recommendation is</span> extending library hours until 5:30pm and adding at least twenty more study spaces. <span class='discourse'>This would transform</span> exam preparation from stressful to manageable.

Can't complain there. Sports hall's got everything we need. <span class='discourse'>But here's the thing</span> - the library's way too small. <span class='discourse'>During exams</span>, it's like a battle royale for seats.

There literally aren't enough seats. I've seen people studying in corridors because they can't get in. The toilets are embarrassing - outdated, sometimes broken. Not what you want when showing parents around, you know? Plus, the Wi-Fi in the older building sections is rubbish.

Recent capital investment in classroom IT equipment has delivered positive outcomes, with all teaching spaces now featuring modern digital resources. The sports facility maintains appropriate equipment standards for curriculum delivery. <span class='discourse'>In contrast</span>, library provision operates beyond optimal capacity during examination periods, creating pressure on available study space.

Toilet facilities, unchanged for over fifteen years, <span class='formal'>fail to meet contemporary standards</span> and constitute a priority maintenance concern. Wi-Fi coverage gaps in older building sections limit students' digital learning access.

Library capacity constraints <span class='recommend'>could be addressed through</span> extended opening hours (until 17:30) and procurement of additional study furniture for examination periods. Wi-Fi infrastructure expansion <span class='formal'>merits capital investment</span> to support digital pedagogy requirements. <span class='discourse'>Overall</span>, these targeted improvements, estimated at £75,000 total capital expenditure, would <span class='formal'>deliver substantial quality-of-life enhancements</span> for the student population.</div></div>",
        "reflective": "<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Introduction</div><div class='section-content'><span class='discourse'>Assessing our school facilities required me to</span> look beyond my personal experience and consider what truly serves a learning community. After consulting 215 students, patterns emerged that revealed not just practical concerns but deeper questions about what we value in education. This report examines our physical spaces and what they communicate about our priorities.</div></div>\n\n<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Current Situation</div><div class='section-content'>Our classrooms tell a story of investment and care - modern technology, maintained spaces, thoughtful design. Teachers and students alike benefit from these choices. <span class='discourse'>Yet walking from</span> these well-resourced rooms to our library reveals a contradiction. The library, meant to be the heart of learning, operates beyond capacity. <span class='discourse'>During exam periods</span>, watching students compete for study space, I wondered: what does it mean to value education if we don't provide space for it? Our toilet facilities, unchanged since the 1990s, speak to deferred maintenance becoming accepted neglect.</div></div>\n\n<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Problems Identified</div><div class='section-content'>The library crisis transcends furniture shortage - it represents a philosophical question about student autonomy. We encourage independent study while providing insufficient space for it. <span class='discourse'>This contradiction creates</span> stress that undermines learning itself. The toilet situation raises dignity concerns; functional facilities aren't luxury but basic respect. The Wi-Fi gaps in older building sections create a two-tier system where <span class='discourse'>location determines</span> access to digital resources, <span class='vocabulary'>inadvertently creating inequality</span> in educational opportunity. These aren't merely inconveniences; they're messages about whose comfort and success we prioritize.</div></div>\n\n<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Recommendations</div><div class='section-content'><span class='recommend'>I propose we reframe these recommendations</span> not as facility improvements but as investments in educational philosophy. Extended library hours and increased study spaces demonstrate that we genuinely support independent learning. Toilet modernization affirms that student dignity matters. Universal Wi-Fi access ensures equitable opportunity regardless of classroom location. <span class='discourse'>These changes would cost</span> approximately £75,000, yet <span class='discourse'>the return exceeds</span> financial calculation - we would be stating clearly that our physical environment should match our educational aspirations. <span class='formal'>Sometimes the most important improvements</span> are the ones that show we've been listening all along.</div></div>"

Teach grammar alongside conversation. Give us homework every week. Provide apps or websites for practicing at home. The course is good but these changes would make it much better.</div></div>",
        "personal": "<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Introduction</div><div class='section-content'><span class='discourse'>Saturday mornings learning French</span> have become my favorite ritual - escaping English immersion, challenging my brain differently, connecting with language I've loved since childhood.

Small class enables personal attention I've never experienced. <span class='discourse'>But conversation-only approach</span> leaves gaps. I confidently speak incorrectly because nobody's systematically teaching grammar. Week-long gaps between classes mean forgetting without homework reinforcement. My progress feels accidental rather than structured.</div></div>\n\n<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Recommendations</div><div class='section-content'><span class='recommend'>My strongest recommendation is</span> ability-based grouping - everyone deserves appropriately challenging instruction. Integrate grammar mini-lessons within conversation context; we need scaffolding alongside practice. Weekly homework assignments would maintain momentum between sessions.

No homework means we forget everything by next week.</div></div>\n\n<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Recommendations</div><div class='section-content'><span class='recommend'>Split into levels</span> so everyone's challenged appropriately.

        "reflective": "<div class='report-section'><div class='section-heading'>Introduction</div><div class='section-content'><span class='discourse'>Evaluating this French course</span> means examining how we learn languages beyond classroom mechanics.
