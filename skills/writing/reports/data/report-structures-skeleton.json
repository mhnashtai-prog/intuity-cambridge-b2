      "neutral": "It was generally felt that the museum provided adequate educational value for most participants. This was mainly due to the well-organized exhibits and knowledgeable tour guides who were able to answer student questions effectively.",
      "praising": "By far the best aspect of the visit was the interactive physics section, which made complex concepts accessible through hands-on experiments. Considering that many students struggle with abstract theories, this hands-on approach proved invaluable.",
      "criticising": "A significant concern amongst students was that the lunch break was too short, lasting only 30 minutes. Since the museum café had long queues and limited seating, many felt rushed and unable to properly enjoy the facility.",
      "recommending": "In order to improve future visits, it is essential that the school allocates at least 45 minutes for lunch breaks. If this change is made, it would help students to feel more relaxed and able to fully appreciate the educational opportunity.",
      "conclusion": "On the whole, it was felt that despite some logistical challenges, our trip was a huge success and greatly enhanced our understanding of scientific principles."
