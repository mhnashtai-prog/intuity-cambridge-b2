The documentary explores different parts of the ocean and the creatures that live there.</p>\n\n<p><span class='discourse'>The thing that really impressed me was</span> how the programme shows different ocean zones. <span class='discourse'>For example</span>, it takes you from the surface down to the <span class='vocabulary'>deep sea</span>, and also visits <span class='vocabulary'>coral reefs</span>. The photography is <span class='vocabulary'>absolutely amazing</span> because the cameras can go very deep underwater and capture things we don't normally see.</p>\n\n<p><span class='discourse'>What I learnt most about was</span> plastic pollution in our oceans. The documentary explained that around 8 million tons of plastic <span class='vocabulary'>reach the oceans</span> every year. <span class='discourse'>As a result</span>, I've <span class='vocabulary'>changed my habits</span> and now I try to use less plastic, especially after seeing how it <span class='vocabulary'>affects marine animals</span>.</p>\n\n<p><span class='opinion'>I would definitely recommend</span> this documentary to everyone.
