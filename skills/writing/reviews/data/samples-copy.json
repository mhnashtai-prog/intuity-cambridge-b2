      "answer": "<p><span class='discourse'>Choosing a documentary can be challenging</span> because there are so many options, but <span class='opinion'>I have to say</span> that Our Oceans is definitely worth watching. It's a BBC documentary that explores different parts of the ocean, from the surface to the deep sea, and introduces viewers to a variety of fascinating creatures.</p>\n\n<p><span class='discourse'>One feature that really stands out is</span> the stunning underwater photography. <span class='discourse'>For example</span>, the programme takes you through coral reefs and even into darker ocean zones we rarely see. The images are <span class='vocabulary'>absolutely breathtaking</span> and the explanations are clear and engaging.</p>\n\n<p><span class='discourse'>What I learnt most about was</span> the problem of plastic pollution. The documentary explains how millions of tons of plastic <span class='vocabulary'>end up in the ocean</span> each year, damaging ecosystems and harming marine life. <span class='discourse'>As a result</span>, I've already <span class='vocabulary'>changed my habits</span> and now try to reduce my plastic use whenever possible.</p>\n\n<p><span class='opinion'>I would definitely recommend</span> this documentary to anyone, <span class='discourse'>whether you're</span> interested in nature or not.

Although I’d seen concerts on TV before, <span class='vocabulary'>experiencing a live performance</span> was completely different.</p>\n\n<p><span class='discourse'>The feature that impressed me most was</span> the music. Ed Sheeran performed many of his <span class='vocabulary'>best-known songs</span> such as Shape of You and Perfect. <span class='discourse'>What made it particularly special was</span> that he performed alone with just his guitar and loop pedal, creating a surprisingly intimate feeling even in such a huge stadium.</p>\n\n<p><span class='discourse'>Another memorable aspect was</span> the atmosphere. Wembley Stadium is <span class='vocabulary'>incredibly large</span>, but it still felt warm and personal thanks to the lighting, the crowd’s energy and the emotional moments throughout the show.
