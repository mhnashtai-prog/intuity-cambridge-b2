          "explanation": "A 'wh-cleft' (pseudo-cleft) uses 'what' to front information for emphasis. The explicit contrast with 'not lack of economic growth' makes the emphasis stronger, rejecting an alternative explanation."

          "explanation": "Combines three emphasis structures: (1) negative inversion with 'not only...but also', (2) it-cleft 'it is this...that' to emphasize which aspect concerns policymakers, and (3) inversion after 'only' ('only by addressing...can societies').
